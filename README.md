# Bluebird Base Containers

This repository is a hard fork of [opennms-base-containers](https://github.com/opennms-forge/opennms-base-container).


> The purpose of this repository is to find a common home for all dependant container images bluebird requires for building.
> This is helpful to be in control of the pipeline, provide images for everything (if there is no official image yet) and avoid floating tags, to have reliable pipeline.
>
> Please note: each container image will build a floating tag and a non floating tag.
